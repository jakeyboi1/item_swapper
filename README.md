# hd_bookie

>This is a simple easily configurable bookie(bet on fights) script for RedM!

## Features
- Spawns 4 bookie npc's around the map with blips at configurable locations!
- When you place a bet it spawns 2 npc's that will fight each other, if the one you bet on wins you win the fight and get the bet money.
- If the one you bet on loses you lose your bet money!
- Fights are on a global cooldown set in the config so you cant abuse it by sitting there. (Make sure there is atleast a 60000 ms cooldown otherwise it will lead to bugs)

## How it works
- Go to one of the bookies hit g when close and bet on a fighter!

## Why use it
- Betting on fights is a fun past time.
- Adds more to do in your server.
- Entertaining fights.
- Simple and effective script.

## Requirements
- VORP Core
- VORP inputs

## Installation Steps

## Side notes
- You can add more locations to this if you edit the code, but you can not add or remove locations from config without actually editing the code if you do it will break the script.
- I will offer support for this, however do note it is not garunteed
- I really hope you enjoy the script thanks for trying it!
- I have optimized this code quite alot, but if you see any code that can be optimized further please open a pull request and I will take a look if it works I will merge it. Or just tell me lol.
- You can edit the code obviously. All I ask is that you release the edits to the community freely.
